# Matt's Modeling Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find my MatLab code that I've developed over my years as an undergraduate student at Miami University. I've used MatLab to model situations in the most prominently in the following areas:
* Vibrations
* Mechanics of Materials
* Systems Modeling
* Dynamics Modeling *
Feel free to leaf through my work and please reach out if any of this work aligns with what you're working on.
