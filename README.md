Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find my MatLab code that I've developed over my years as an undergraduate student at Miami University. I've used MatLab to model situations in the most prominently for **vibrations**, **controls**, and **dynamic systems applications**.

Feel free to leaf through my work and please reach out if any of this work aligns with what you're working on.

Further, if you'd like to see some of my design work, you can visit my mechanical design portfolio at this [link.](https://www.mattcowley.me)

Thank you again for your interest in my work!
